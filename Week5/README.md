### BioProject and SRR accession numbers for the sequencing data associated with the publication.

### Create a bash shell script with the code from last week.
### Add commands to download at least one sequencing dataset using the SRR number(s).
### Download only a subset of the data that would provide approximately 10x genome coverage. Briefly explain how you estimated the amount of data needed for 10x coverage.
### Quality assessment: Generate basic statistics on the downloaded reads (e.g., number of reads, total bases, average read length).
### Run FASTQC on the downloaded data to generate a quality report.
### Evaluate the FASTQC report and summarize your findings.
### (optional) Perform any necessary quality control steps (e.g., trimming, filtering) and briefly describe your process (optional)
### Search the SRA for another dataset for the same genome, but generated using a different sequencing platform (e.g., if original data was Illumina select PacBio or Oxford Nanopore).
### Briefly compare the quality or characteristics of the datasets from the two platforms.
