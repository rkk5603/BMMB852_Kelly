You can reuse the Makefile developed for your previous assignment, which generated a VCF file. You will also need an annotation file in GFF format.

### Evaluate the effects of the variants in your VCF file.

### Use a variant effect prediction tool like snpEff or VEP.  Add the effect prediction steps to your Makefile and make them part of the workflow.

### If, for some reason, you can't make any of the variant effect prediction software work, you may use visual inspection via IGV to describe the effect of variants relative to a reference genome and an annotation file.

### Identify variants with different effects.

### Write a markdown report that summarizes the process and your results.
