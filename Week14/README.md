# Perform a differential expression analysis on an RNA-Seq count matrix.
This assignment demonstrates the entire RNA-seq analysis workflow; 
- Producing BAM files from alignments performed on FASTQ reads
- Generating a read count matrix from the BAM files
- Visualization of differential gene expression among samples
- Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs

### Obtain reads

### Perform the alignment
### Generate PCA and heatmap visualizations of your data
### Identify a set of differentially expressed genes or transcripts
### Perform functional enrichment analysis on your differentially expressed genes
